# 🎬 SQL Film Database Project

This project was part of my Data Analytics bootcamp and focuses on querying a film rental database using SQL.

## 🧠 Objective

To explore and extract meaningful insights from a movie rental database by writing SQL queries that answer specific business questions related to:

- Film categories and release years  
- Customer behavior by rental history  
- Actor appearances and popularity  
- Rating-based filtering  
- Revenue by genre or time period

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **SQL (PostgreSQL)**
- JOINs (INNER, LEFT, SELF)
- GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY
- Filtering with WHERE and CASE statements
- Regular expressions (REGEXP)
- Subqueries and CTEs

---

## 🔍 Key Questions Solved

- 🔢 How many films were released per year and by category?
- 🎭 Which actor appears in the most films?
- ⭐ What are the top-rated films by average rental duration?
- 💰 Which genres generate the most revenue?
- 📅 What’s the rental trend over time?

## 📌 What I Learned

This project reinforced my understanding of SQL logic, complex joins, subqueries, and data grouping. It also taught me how to translate real-world questions into structured database queries — a key skill in data analysis.

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Build visualizations from query results using Tableau or Power BI  
- Automate reporting from SQL queries using Python
